**PyCitySchools: School Performance Analysis**

*Project Description:*
This analysis is meant to help a school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

First, analyze the district-wide standardized test results, then aggregate the data to showcase trends in school performance.

**Analysis**
Out of 15 total schools, just over two thirds of students are passing overall (65%), with the highest performing school being Cabrera high school (91%); the school needing the most improvement is Rodriguez High School (53%).  

Larger schools tend to have lower overall passing rates compared to medium and small schools; similarly, District schools have fewer students passing overall compared to Charter schools. 

The higher the budget spend per student, the lower the overall passing rate; this suggests a budgeting audit may help support students in need of additional academic support.

*Challenges*
Because this is my first attempt at using Pandas and Jupyter, I came across several challenges, including (but not limited to) amending data types in order to calculate required values and reseting kernels to run code effectively.

*To Use*
Run the script in Jupyter.
